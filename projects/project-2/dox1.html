    <div class="patient-answer">True! — nervous — very, very dreadfully nervous <span class="redaction">I had been and am;</span>but why will you say that I am mad? The <span class="redaction">disease had sharpened</span> my senses — not destroyed — not dulled them. Above all was the sense of <span class="redaction">hearing</span> acute. I heard all things in the <span class="redaction">heaven</span> and in the <span class="redaction">earth.</span> I heard many things in <span class="redaction">hell.</span> How, then, am I mad? Hearken! and observe how healthily — <span class="redaction">how calmly </span> I can tell you the whole story.

It is impossible to say <span class="redaction">how first the idea </span> entered my brain; but once conceived, <span class="redaction">it haunted me day and night. Object</span> there was none. <span class="redaction">Passion</span> there was none. <span class="redaction">I</span> loved<span class="redaction"> the old man.</span> He had <span class="redaction">never</span> wronged me. He had <span class="redaction">never</span> given me insult. For his gold I had no desire. I think it was his <span class="redaction">eye</span>! yes, it was this! <span class="redaction">One of his eyes resembled that of a vulture — a pale blue eye</span>, with a film over it. Whenever it fell upon me, <span class="redaction">my blood ran cold;</span> and so by degrees — very gradually — I made up my mind to <span class="redaction">take the life of the old man,</span> and thus rid myself of the eye <span class="redaction">forever.</span>

Now this is the point. You  <span class="redaction">fancy me mad</span>. Madmen know <span class="redaction">nothing.</span> But you should have seen me. You should have seen how <span class="redaction">wisely</span> I proceeded — with <span class="redaction">what caution</span> — with <span class="redaction">what foresight</span> — with <span class="redaction">what dissimulation</span> I went to work! I was <span class="redaction">never kinder to the old man</span> than during the whole week before <span class="redaction">I killed him.</span> And every night, about midnight, I turned the latch of his door and opened it — oh, so gently! And then, when I had made an opening sufficient for my head, I put in a dark lantern, all closed, closed, so that no light shone out, and then I thrust in my head. Oh, you would have laughed to see how cunningly I thrust it in! I moved it slowly — very, very slowly, so that I might not disturb the old man’s sleep. It took me an hour to place my whole head within the opening so far that I could see him as he lay upon his bed. Ha! — would a madman have been so wise as this? And then, when my head was well in the room, I undid the lantern cautiously — oh, so cautiously — cautiously (for the hinges creaked) — I undid it just so much that a single thin ray fell upon the vulture eye. And this I did for seven long nights — every night just at midnight — but I found the eye always closed; and so it was impossible to do the work; for it was not the old man who vexed me, but his Evil Eye. And every morning, when the day broke, I went boldly into the chamber, and spoke courageously to him, calling him by name in a hearty tone, and inquiring how he had passed the night. So you see he would have been a very profound old man, indeed, to suspect that every night, just at twelve, I looked in upon him while he slept.
