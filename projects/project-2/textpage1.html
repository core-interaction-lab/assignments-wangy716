            The disease had sharpened my senses — not destroyed — not dulled them.

        <div class="line3">
            Above all was the sense of hearing acute.

            It is impossible to say how first the idea entered my brain; but once conceived, it haunted me day and night.

        <div class="line8">
            Object there was none.<br>Passion there was none.

            I loved the old man. 
        </div> 
        <div class="line10">
            He had never wronged me. 
<br>He had never given me insult. 
<br>For his gold I had no desire. 
        </div> 
        <div class="line11">
            I think it was his eye!
        </div> 
        <div class="line12">
            yes, it was this! 
        </div> 
        <div class="line13">
            One of his eyes resembled that of a vulture — a pale blue eye, with a film over it. 
        </div> 
        <div class="line14">
            Whenever it fell upon me, my blood ran cold; 
        </div> 
        <div class="line15">
            and so by degrees — very gradually — I made up my mind to take the life of the old man, and thus rid myself of the eye forever.
