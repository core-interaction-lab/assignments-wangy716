What <span class="redaction">happened on</span> the eighth day?

      Upon the eighth night I was <span class="redaction">more than usually cautious</span> in opening the door. A watch’s minute hand moves <span class="redaction">more quickly</span> than did mine. Never before that night had I felt the extent of <span class="redaction">my own powers</span> — of my <span class="redaction">sagacity</span>. I could <span class="redaction">scarcely</span> contain my feelings of <span class="redaction">triumph</span>. To think that there I was, opening the door, <span class="redaction">little by little,</span> and he not even to dream of <span class="redaction">my secret deeds </span>or thoughts. I fairly <span class="redaction">chuckled</span> at the idea; and perhaps he <span class="redaction">heard</span> me; for he moved on the bed suddenly, as if startled. Now you may think that <span class="redaction">I drew back — but no</span>. His room was as black as pitch with the thick darkness, <span class="redaction">(for the shutters were close fastened, through fear of robbers,)</span> and so I knew that he could not <span class="redaction">see</span> the opening of the door, and I kept pushing it on steadily, <span class="redaction">steadily</span>. I had my head in, and was about to open the <span class="redaction">lantern</span>, when my thumb <span class="redaction">slipped upon </span>the tin fastening, and the old man <span class="redaction">sprang up</span> in the bed, crying out — <span class="redaction">“Who’s there?”</span>

So, did you stop the <span class="redaction">murder</span> again?

      No,no,no. The eighth day is <span class="redaction">wonderful</span>! I kept quite still and said nothing. <span class="redaction">For a whole hour</span> I did not move a muscle, and in the meantime I did not <span class="redaction">hear</span> him lie down. He was still sitting up in the bed <span class="redaction">listening; — just as I have done</span>, night after night, hearkening to the <span class="redaction">death</span> watches in the wall.
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      Presently I heard a <span class="redaction">slight groan</span>, and I knew it was the groan of <span class="redaction">mortal terror</span>. It was not a groan of <span class="redaction">pain or of grief — oh, no!</span> - it was the low stifled sound that <span class="redaction">arises from the bottom of the soul</span> when overcharged with awe. I knew <span class="redaction">the sound</span> well. Many a night, just at <span class="redaction">midnight</span>, when all the world slept, it has <span class="redaction">welled up</span> from my own bosom, deepening, with its <span class="redaction">dreadful echo,</span> the terrors that <span class="redaction">distracted me.</span> I say I knew it well. <span class="redaction">I knew what the old man felt, and pitied him</span>, although I chuckled at <span class="redaction">heart</span>. I knew that he had been lying <span class="redaction">awake ever</span> since the first slight <span class="redaction">noise</span>, when he had <span class="redaction">turned in</span> the bed. His <span class="redaction">fears had been ever since growing upon him. He had been trying to fancy them causeless, but could not. He had been saying</span> to himself — “It is nothing but <span class="redaction">the wind in the chimney</span> — it is only <span class="redaction">a mouse crossing the floor</span>,” or “it is merely a<span class="redaction"> cricket</span> which has made a single chirp.” Yes, he has been trying <span class="redaction">to comfort himself</span> with these suppositions: but he had found <span class="redaction">all in vain.</span> All in vain; because <span class="redaction">Death, in approaching</span> him had stalked with his <span class="redaction">black shadow</span> before him, and enveloped the <span class="redaction">victim</span> And it was the <span class="redaction">mournful influence</span> of the unperceived shadow that caused him to feel — although he <span class="redaction"> neither saw nor heard — </span>to feel the presence of <span class="redaction">my head</span> within the room.
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      When I had waited a long time, <span class="redaction">very patiently</span>, without hearing him lie down, I resolved to <span class="redaction">open a little — a very,</span> very little crevice in the lantern. So I opened it — <span class="redaction">you cannot imagine</span> how <span class="redaction">stealthily, stealthily — </span> until, at length <span class="redaction">a single dim ray</span>, like the <span class="redaction">thread of the spider</span>, shot from out the crevice and fell upon the <span class="redaction">vulture</span> eye.
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      It was open — <span class="redaction">wide, wide open</span> — and I grew <span class="redaction">furious</span> as I gazed upon it. I saw it with <span class="redaction">perfect distinctness</span> — all a dull blue, with a <span class="redaction">hideous veil over it that chilled </span> the very marrow in my <span class="redaction">bones</span>; but I could see <span class="redaction">nothing else of</span> the old man’s face or person: for I had directed the ray as if by instinct, <span class="redaction">precisely upon the damned spot</span>.
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      And now have I <span class="redaction">not told you that</span> what you mistake for <span class="redaction">madness</span> is but over <span class="redaction">acuteness of the senses</span>? — now, I say, there came to my ears a <span class="redaction">low, dull, quick sound,</span> such as a watch makes when enveloped in cotton. I knew that <span class="redaction">sound well, too.</span> It was the <span class="redaction">beating of the old man’s heart</span>. It increased my <span class="redaction">fury</span>, as the beating of a drum <span class="redaction">stimulates the soldier</span> into courage.
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      But even yet I<span class="redaction">refrained</span> and <span class="redaction">kept still</span>. I <span class="redaction">scarcely breathed</span>. I <span class="redaction">held the lantern motionless</span>. I <span class="redaction">tried how steadily</span> I <span class="redaction">could maintain the ray upon the eye</span>. Meantime the hellish tattoo of <span class="redaction">the heart</span> increased. It grew quicker and <span class="redaction">quicker</span>, and louder and <span class="redaction">louder</span> every instant. The old man’s <span class="redaction">terror</span> must <span class="redaction">have been extreme</span>! It grew louder, <span class="redaction">I say,</span> louder every moment! — <span class="redaction">do you mark me well</span>? I <span class="redaction">have told you that</span> I am nervous<span class="redaction">: so I am.</span> And now at the dead hour of the night, <span class="redaction">amid the dreadful silence</span> of that old house, so <span class="redaction">strange</span> a noise as this excited me to <span class="redaction">uncontrollable terror</span>. Yet, for some minutes longer I <span class="redaction">refrained and stood still.</span> But the beating grew louder, louder! I thought the <span class="redaction">heart must burst</span>. And now a new <span class="redaction">anxiety</span> seized me — <span class="redaction">the sound would be heard by a neighbor!</span> The old man’s hour had come! With a loud yell, I <span class="redaction">threw open the lantern and leaped into the room.</span> He shrieked once — <span class="redaction">once only</span>. In an instant I <span class="redaction">dragged him to the floor</span>, and <span class="redaction">pulled the heavy bed over him</span>. I <span class="redaction">then smiled gaily</span>, to find the deed so far done. But, for many minutes, <span class="redaction">the heart beat on with a muffled sound.</span> This, however, did not vex me; it would not be <span class="redaction">heard</span> through the wall. At length it ceased. <span class="redaction">The old man was dead.</span> I <span class="redaction">removed the bed and examined the corpse</span>. Yes, he was stone, stone <span class="redaction">dead.</span> I <span class="redaction">placed my hand upon the heart and held it there many minutes.</span> There was no pulsation. <span class="redaction">He was stone dead.</span> His <span class="redaction">eye</span> would trouble me no more.
