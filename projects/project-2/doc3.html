      Of course, Doctor! If still you think me mad, you will think so <span class="redaction">no longer</span> when I <span class="redaction">describe the wise precautions</span> I took for the <span class="redaction">concealment</span> of the body. The night waned, and I <span class="redaction">worked hastily</span>, but <span class="redaction">in silence</span>. First of all I <span class="redaction">dismembered the corpse</span>. I <span class="redaction">cut off</span> the head and the arms and the legs.

      I <span class="redaction">then took up three planks</span> from the flooring of <span class="redaction">the chamber</span>, and <span class="redaction">deposited all</span> between the scantlings. I <span class="redaction">then replaced</span> the boards <span class="redaction">so cleverly, so cunningly,</span> that no human <span class="redaction">eye</span> — not even his — could have detected anything <span class="redaction">wrong</span>. There was <span class="redaction">nothing</span> to wash out — <span class="redaction">no stain of any kind — no blood-spot</span> whatever. I had been too wary for that. A tub had caught all — <span class="redaction">ha! ha!</span>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      When I <span class="redaction">had made an end of these labors</span>, it was four o ‘clock — still <span class="redaction">dark</span> as midnight. As <span class="redaction">the bell</span> sounded the hour, there came a <span class="redaction">knocking</span> at the street door. I went down to open it with <span class="redaction">a light heart</span>, — for what had I <span class="redaction">now to fear</span>? There <span class="redaction">entered</span> three men, who introduced themselves, with <span class="redaction">perfect</span> suavity, as <span class="redaction">officers of the police.</span> A shriek had been <span class="redaction">heard</span> by a neighbor during the night; <span class="redaction">suspicion of foul play</span> had been aroused; <span class="redaction">information</span> had been lodged at the police office, and they <span class="redaction">(the officers)</span> had been deputed to search <span class="redaction">the premises</span>

      HAHA! I smiled! <span class="redaction">— for what had I to fear?</span> I <span class="redaction">bade</span> the gentlemen welcome. <span class="redaction">The shriek,</span> I said, <span class="redaction">was my own in a dream.</span> The old man, I mentioned, <span class="redaction">was absent in the country</span>. I <span class="redaction">took my visitors</span> all over <span class="redaction">the house</span>. I bade them search — <span class="redaction">search well</span>. I <span class="redaction">led them</span>, at length, to his chamber. I <span class="redaction">showed them his</span> treasures, secure, undisturbed. In the enthusiasm of <span class="redaction">my confidence</span>, I <span class="redaction">brought chairs</span> into the room, and <span class="redaction">desired</span> them here to rest from their fatigues, <span class="redaction">while I myself</span>, in the wild audacity of <span class="redaction">my perfect triumph,</span> placed my <span class="redaction">own seat</span> upon the very spot beneath which <span class="redaction">reposed the corpse</span> of the victim.
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      The officers were <span class="redaction">satisfied</span>. My manner had <span class="redaction">convinced</span> them. I <span class="redaction">was singularly</span> at ease. They sat, and while I <span class="redaction">answered cheerily</span>, they <span class="redaction">chatted</span> of familiar things. But, <span class="redaction">ere long</span>, I <span class="redaction">felt myself getting pale</span> and <span class="redaction">wished them gone</span>. My head ached, and I <span class="redaction">fancied a ringing in my ears</span>: but still they <span class="redaction">sat</span> and still <span class="redaction">chatted</span>. The ringing became <span class="redaction">more distinct: — it</span> continued and became more distinct: I <span class="redaction">talked more freely</span> to get rid of the feeling: but it <span class="redaction">continued and gained definitiveness</span> — until, at length, I <span class="redaction">found that the noise</span> was not <span class="redaction">within</span> my ears.
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      No doubt I now <span class="redaction">grew very pale</span> — but I talked more <span class="redaction">fluently</span>, and with a <span class="redaction">heightened voice</span>. Yet the sound increased — and what could I <span class="redaction">do</span>? It was a <span class="redaction">low, dull, quick</span> sound — much such a sound as <span class="redaction">a watch makes</span> when enveloped in cotton. I <span class="redaction">gasped for breath</span> — and yet the officers <span class="redaction">heard it</span> not. I <span class="redaction">talked</span> more quickly — more <span class="redaction">vehemently</span>; but the noise steadily <span class="redaction">increased.</span> I <span class="redaction">arose and argued</span> about trifles, in a <span class="redaction">high</span> key and with <span class="redaction">violent gesticulations</span>; but the noise <span class="redaction">steadily increased</span>. Why would they not be gone? I <span class="redaction">paced the floor</span> to and fro with <span class="redaction">heavy strides</span>, as if excited to <span class="redaction">fury by the observations</span> of the men — but the <span class="redaction">noise steadily increased</span>. Oh God! <span class="redaction">what could I do</span>? I foamed — I raved — I swore! I <span class="redaction">swung the chair upon</span> which I had been sitting, and <span class="redaction">grated it upon the boards</span>, but the noise arose over all and <span class="redaction">continually increased.</span> It grew louder — louder — louder! <span class="redaction">And still the men chatted pleasantly,</span> and smiled. Was it possible they heard not? <span class="redaction">Almighty God</span>! — no, no! They heard! — <span class="redaction">they suspected!</span> — they knew! — <span class="redaction">they were making a mockery of my horror!</span> — this I thought, and this I <span class="redaction">think</span>. But anything was <span class="redaction">better than this agony</span>! Anything was <span class="redaction">more tolerable than this derision</span>! I could bear those <span class="redaction">hypocritical</span> smiles no longer! I felt that I <span class="redaction">must scream or die</span>! — and now — again! — hark! <span class="redaction">louder! louder! louder! louder!</span> —
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <span class="redaction">“Villains!”</span> I shrieked, <span class="redaction">“dissemble no more! I admit the deed!</span> — <span class="redaction">tear up</span> the planks! — <span class="redaction">here,</span> here! — it is <span class="redaction">the beating</span> of his hideous <span class="redaction">heart</span>!”
