You look <span class="redaction">nervous</span> today. What happened?

    <div class="patient-answer">
True! — nervous — very, very dreadfully nervous <span class="redaction">I had been and am;</span>but why will you say that I am mad? The <span class="redaction">disease had sharpened</span> my senses — not destroyed — not dulled them. Above all was the sense of <span class="redaction">hearing</span> acute. I heard all things in the <span class="redaction">heaven</span> and in the <span class="redaction">earth.</span> I heard many things in <span class="redaction">hell.</span> How, then, am I mad? Hearken! and observe how healthily — <span class="redaction">how calmly </span> I can tell you the whole story.
<br>
<br>
<br>
It is impossible to say <span class="redaction">how first the idea </span> entered my brain; but once conceived, <span class="redaction">it haunted me day and night. Object</span> there was none. <span class="redaction">Passion</span> there was none. I loved<span class="redaction"> the old man.</span> He had <span class="redaction">never</span> wronged me. He had <span class="redaction">never</span> given me insult. For his gold I had no desire. I think it was his <span class="redaction">eye</span>! yes, it was this! <span class="redaction">One of his eyes resembled that of a vulture — a pale blue eye</span>, with a film over it. Whenever it fell upon me, <span class="redaction">my blood ran cold;</span> and so by degrees — very gradually — I made up my mind to <span class="redaction">take the life of the old man,</span> and thus rid myself of the eye <span class="redaction">forever.</span>

Now this is the point. You  <span class="redaction">fancy me mad</span>. Madmen know <span class="redaction">nothing.</span> But you should have seen me. You should have seen how <span class="redaction">wisely</span> I proceeded — with <span class="redaction">what caution</span> — with <span class="redaction">what foresight</span> — with <span class="redaction">what dissimulation</span> I went to work! I was <span class="redaction">never kinder to the old man</span> than during the whole week before <span class="redaction">I killed him.</span> And every night, about midnight, I turned the latch of his door and opened it — oh, <span class="redaction">so gently</span>! And then, when I had made an <span class="redaction">opening sufficient</span> for my head, I put in a dark lantern, <span class="redaction">all closed, closed,</span> so that no light shone out, and then I <span class="redaction">thrust</span> in my head. Oh, you would have <span class="redaction">laughed to see</span> how cunningly I thrust it in! I moved it <span class="redaction">slowly — </span>very, very slowly, so that I might <span class="redaction">not disturb</span> the old man’s sleep. It took me <span class="redaction">an hour</span> to place my whole head within the opening so far that <span class="redaction">I could see him </span>as he lay upon his bed. Ha! — would <span class="redaction">a madman</span> have been so wise as this? And then, when my head was well in the room, I undid the lantern <span class="redaction">cautiously — oh, so cautiously</span> — <span class="redaction">cautiously</span> (for the hinges creaked) — I undid it just so much that a single thin ray fell upon the <span class="redaction">vulture</span> eye. And this I did for <span class="redaction">seven long nights</span> — every night just <span class="redaction">at midnight</span> — but I found <span class="redaction">the eye always </span>closed; and so it was <span class="redaction">impossible</span> to do the work; for it was not the old man who <span class="redaction">vexed</span> me, but his <span class="redaction">Evil Eye.</span> And every morning, when the day broke, I went boldly <span class="redaction">into the chamber</span>, and spoke courageously to him, calling him by name in a <span class="redaction">hearty tone</span>, and inquiring how he had passed the night. So you see he would have been a very <span class="redaction">profound</span> old man, indeed, to suspect that every night, just <span class="redaction">at twelve</span>, I looked in upon him while he slept.
