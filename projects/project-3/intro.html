            I got inspiration from the 16 MBTI personality test for this project. I made up a series of questions that can determine what color people like, and then through random javascript selection within that color range, define each user a specific lego figure representation. The test is designed for elastic collection, which it will work no matter how many lego figures in the airtable. (src: Jessie Kil's 100 lego figure airtable) - Yi Wang<BR><BR><br>
